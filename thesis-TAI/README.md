# Audit the Trustworthiness of AutoML tools

This repository contains the code developed for the thesis of the course of "Machine Learning and Data Analysis".

This is the description of the files that are present in this repository:

* CRIME_implementation.ipynb contains the code related to the deployment of a model on Vertex AI trained over the CRIME dataset. In this code, there is the audit of Fariness and Explainability
* CRIME_local_implementation.ipynb contains the same things present in the code before mentioned, but tested on a model trained locally
* MNIST_implementation.ipynbcontains the code related to the deployment of a model on Vertex AI trained over the MNIST dataset. In this code there, is the audit of Privacy
* MNIST_local_implementation.ipynb contains the same present in the code before mentioned plus the audit of Robustness, which must be done on a local instance of the model


All the files are Python Notebook, written with the help of Google Colab.
